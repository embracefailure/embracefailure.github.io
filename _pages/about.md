<h1>
  🥰 Hi there my No.
  <img src="https://profile-counter.glitch.me/embracefailure/count.svg"/>
  visitor!
</h1>

I'm Timmy Wen, a next generation engineer who takes actions quickly to validate ideas and iterate for innovation. 

To broaden my horizons and team up with talents from the community, I build my community as a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador.

I dream about solving problems with technology, so I am practising empowering people and working on cool projects.

With experience in previous research on semantic segmentation, I am currently interested in Deep Learning. 

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss ideas or explore new possibilities in tech innovation!
