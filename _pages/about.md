<h1>
  ü•∞ Hi
  <!-- <img src="https://profile-counter.glitch.me/embracefailure/count.svg"/>
  visitor! -->
</h1>

I'm Timmy Wen, a next generation engineer who takes actions quickly to validate ideas and iterate for innovation. 

To broaden my horizons and team up with talents from the community, I build my community as a Microsoft Learn Student Ambassador.

I dream about solving problems with technology, so I am practising empowering people and working on cool projects.

I am currently interested in computer vision and robotics, I'm also amazed by the potential that Agent AI brings to existing workflow.

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss ideas or explore new possibilities in tech innovation!

# üéì Projects
- *2025.3*: &nbsp;Worked on [Lerobot](https://github.com/embracefailure/lerobot), trained a policy using [ALOHA ACT](https://github.com/tonyzhaozh/aloha) on the [mobile_shrimp](https://huggingface.co/datasets/lerobot/aloha_mobile_shrimp) dataset.
- *2025.3*: &nbsp;Contributed to this [Embodied AI Guide](https://github.com/TianxingChen/Embodied-AI-Guide). Happy to be a part of the community!
- *2025.2*: &nbsp;I worked on using Reinforcement Learning to recycle a virtual rocket. Based on this GitHub project [Rocket Recycling using RL](https://github.com/jiupinjia/rocket-recycling). I find this [Explanation on Actor-Critic Algorithm](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/actor-critic-algorithm-in-reinforcement-learning/) really helpful.  
- *2025.1*: &nbsp;Used Knowledge Distillation to transfer knowledge from a DNN for image classification task on CIFAR-10. With the help of [Pytorch Tutorials](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/knowledge_distillation_tutorial.html)
